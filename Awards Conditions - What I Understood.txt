As far as Blue Star award is concerned, I am planning to reduce it's quality every day.
This will ensure lower quality on days further away from the granted date.
Also, I will be expiring the Blue Star twice as fast so that it can be set to 0
twice as fast as compared to Blue Compare and Blue First Awards.
